# 🚦 AI-Based Traffic Management System

An **AI-powered smart traffic control system** that analyzes traffic density from multiple road videos and intelligently optimizes traffic light timings using **YOLO-based vehicle detection** and a **Genetic Algorithm**.

This project is designed so that **even someone with zero Python background** can run it by following this README step by step.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Traditional traffic lights follow **fixed timing**, which causes:
- long waiting times
- congestion
- inefficient traffic flow
